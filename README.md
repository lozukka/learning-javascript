Just some simple little projects where I learn Javascript

## What I do:

Learning Javascript, or re-learn. I asked AI to do me a learning path about Javascript. I also asked it to do a list of project that I could train my Javascript knowledge.

## What I have learned:

- how to print to DOM
- variables and function

# Project 2: A simple calculator

I learned:

- how to change <input> values to numbers
- if & else if & else structure
- also eventlistener!
- how to debug script when it doesn't work

# Project 3: A click counter

I learned:

- this was kindof refresh project, where I needed to do again some basic things that I did in project 1 and 2
- add 1 to value
- manipulate the DOM
