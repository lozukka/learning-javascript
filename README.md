## learning-javascript

Just some simple little projects where I learn Javascript

## What I do:

Learning Javascript, or re-learn. I asked AI to do me a learning path about Javascript. I also asked it to do a list of project that I could train my Javascript knowledge.

## What I have learned:

# Project 1: A temperature converter

I learned:

- how to read <input> values
- how to print to DOM
- variables and function

# Project 2: A simple calculator

I learned:

- how to change <input> values to numbers
- if & else if & else structure
- also eventlistener!
- how to debug script when it doesn't work

# Project 3: A click counter

I learned:

- this was kindof refresh project, where I needed to do again some basic things that I did in project 1 and 2
- add 1 to value
- manipulate the DOM

# Project 4: Greeting the name

This time I did first my version of the assigment. Very simple and basic.
Then I asked ChatGPT to a script. Oh boy, I learned a lot.

- I added a function that gives a different greeting at different times of the day.
- I added a function that trims and normalize given text.
  -I wrote the submit event listener a little different this time.
